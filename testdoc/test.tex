\section*{PROBLEM 1:}
This is a test paragraph, whose sole purpose is to fill in the blank. In this paragraph I am including a mathematical expression embedded inline: $x^2 = y^2 + z^2$.

This is the above mathematical expression:
\[x^2 = y^2 + z^2\]

In this section, we are going to try a few other math expressions. First is the Sum expression:
\[ \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} 2^{-N} = 1 \]

\section*{PROBLEM 2:}
In this section, we are going to try a few other math expressions. First is the Sum expression:
\[ \sum_{N=0}^{\infty} 2^{-N} = 1 \]

Let's say we have an algorithm with a linear time complexity: $O(N)$.

Let's say we also have an algorithm with time complexity: $O(N logN)$.
